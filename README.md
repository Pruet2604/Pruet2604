- Howdy! I'm @Pruet2604, but you may call me Austin.
- As of right now I am really into Fallout and Dungeons and Dragons!
- I am currently teaching myself Python both for professional use and personal projects.
- I'm really not great at this stuff yet so please bear with any atrocious coding errors that might be uploaded to this.
